# Requirements for Spting
## Maven Repository
    * Maven is a repository which has all the required dependensy. 
    * It is like platform or like junction. 
    * where we able to get required dependensy  
    * At first starting of our project we need to dwonload required dependency form the Remote Server of Maven.'
    * once, It has been completed at the first time we dont need to do the same thing like downloading the dependency for our project
    * it will automatically create a local repositor in our system where we use the needful.
    
   ### The main Theme concept of Maven is to provide dependency 
   ### Not only Maven will provide all of these stuffs there are some other stuffs like Gradle..
##  xml
   xml is a ** Extensible MarkUp Language ** 
   Like in html there are inbuilt tags 
   ```html
      <b> Bold </b>
      <p> This is bold tag "<b> </b>" </p>
   ```
   We may also able to create our own tags we Extensible our own markup language
   ** xml ** does this
   
   There is a case where I want to get data form server the way to achieve thing is using html
   
   But I don't want the design tags I want only the data
   
   XML achieve this
   
   ```xml
      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
